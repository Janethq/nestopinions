# NestOpinion

A property review app with reviews by your fellow home searchers!

## Description / User Story

As a home searcher, I want to read honest home listings because the current propery apps available are only written up by property agents who try to paint a more rosy picture due to their own interests which might not be as aligned with the home searcher. On the contrary, fellow home searchers all have the same goals - to find the perfect home according to their needs.

Everyone has different requirements and opinions to what constitutes a perfect home and so as a user, they would want to be able to filter through relevant search queries while looking for their house.

As some things are quite subjective when it comes to housing opinions, it would be beneficial to look at the house from different perspectives of your fellow home searchers and see if there are other things that you have failed to consider but actually found it quite critical in your search for the perfect home.

Implement a search functionality for properties based on multiple criteria: area, postal code, and HDB type and handles potential errors.

### Seed properties and seed function

<img src="screenshots/seedproperties.png">

The seed data consists of information for properties. The seed function is an asynchronous process that is used to reset and populate the Property database collection with predefined data. The seed function clears the existing property data in the database and replaces it with new data from seedData. It logs messages to the console at each step to confirm the operations and sends back the newly inserted data as a JSON response.

### Embedded

<img src="screenshots/embedreview.png">

A property can have many reviews, which is a one-to-many relationship. Embedding occurs when a child subdocument (review) is embedded within its parent document (property).

### Key Takeaways

Working on this project as a team requires clear communication and effective project management. I am grateful that my team is very efficient in setting direction and goals for the project. For me, documenting the process has been a huge part of this project. Spending time planning my schedule, estimating and visualizing what I can complete, strategizing on how to tackle errors, and setting mini to-do lists the day before helps me manage myself and ensure good overall team progression.
